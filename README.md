# Remarks on the analysis of steady-state responses: spurious artifacts introduced by overlapping epochs
Lucas Benjamin, Ghislaine Dehaene-Lambertz, Ana Fl√≥

This repository contains the scripts and data used to compute the simulation presented in the Cortex Commentary on neural entrainment (by Benjamin et al. 2021)

To compute the neural entrainment based on the method proposed by Batterink and Paller 2017, the newtimef function of EEGLAB is requiered (we used version 2021.0).
